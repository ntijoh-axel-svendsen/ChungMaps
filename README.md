account creation and management:

every turtle should have its own id :apikeyaccount
id :apikey

accounts are created when the init pastebin is ran and the turtle 
does not have a .key file 

//the name of .key is subject to change

the .key file should contain the credentials of the turtle
which are automatically genereated at the same time as the account
